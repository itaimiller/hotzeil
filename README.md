Hotze Israel
============

**Crossing Israel - The line between center and periphery**

Hotze Israel (or Crossing Israel, in loose translation) is a set of interactive web experiences, aimed to raise awareness to the raising gaps between center and periphery in Israel. The project contains several visually and conceptually distinguish screens. Each screen visualize statistic describing a social, economical, cultural, educational or healthcare related gap. With different interactions and visual style, I used this platform to convey my own opinion about the gaps.

The project secondary aim is to create unique visual database of statistics, and become a sort of blog, updated with users suggestions and interpretation.
